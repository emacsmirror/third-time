# Third Time

[Third Time](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RWu8eZqbwgB9zaerh/third-time-a-better-way-to-work) support for Emacs.

## Installation

This package is compatible with Emacs >= 27.1 and has no external dependencies.
The file `third-time.el` may be placed on the `load-path` and `require`d or auto-loaded.

## Usage

It is recommended that you bind `third-time-start-work` to `C-x M-t w` (or `third-time-prefix w`, see below for information about the prefix).

The command `third-time-start-work` (`C-x M-t w`) starts or restarts work.
It enables the mode if it is not enabled.

The command `third-time-start-break` (`C-x M-t b`) starts a break.
If the prefix argument is passed, it will prompt for how long the break should be, otherwise, all remaining break time is used instead.

`third-time-long-break` (`C-x M-t l`, `C-x M-t m`) starts a long (or meal) break.

`third-time-end-session` (`C-x M-t e`, `C-x M-t s`) ends a Third Time session (i.e., workday).

Finally, the command `third-time-summary` (`C-x M-t S`) describes the current status, including current time in state, and information about break times.

## Configuration

The variable `third-time-prefix` defaults to `C-x M-t`, and is the prefix for the minor mode's bindings.
If you wish the bindings to be under a different prefix, you must set the variable *before* loading `third-time.el`.

`third-time-fraction` controls what fraction of time is used for breaks.
It should be a positive integer.

The hooks `third-time-working-hook`, `third-time-break-hook`, `third-time-long-break-hook`, and `third-time-change-hook` are run on state changes.
Those with a named state are run on change to that state, and `third-time-change-hook` is run for all changes.
`third-time-mode-hook` is run when the mode is enabled.

### Logging

This library supports logging of state changes when `third-time-log-file` is a string referring to a file.
The variables `third-time-log-format` and `third-time-log-time-format` control the log format, the latter of which should comply with `format-time-string`.

`third-time-log-format` describes what a log entry looks like.
It may contain the following formatting codes:

 - `%T`: the time as formatted using `third-time-log-time-format`.
 - `%s`: the state entered.
 - `%h`: the time which has been worked at `%T`.
 - `%b`: the time remaining for breaks.

### Alerting

`third-time` uses a simple minibuffer message alerting mechanism by default.
This can be overriden with `third-time-alert-function` which should be a function which takes one argument, a message to alert the user with.
Other information can be `third-time-state` for more advanced formatting.

Additionally, there's a "nag" timer which can be used to periodically remind the user that a break has been completed.
It is controlled with the `third-time-nag-time` which is a number of minutes, if it is 0, no nagging will take place.

##  External Package Integration: Universal Sidecar

Users of the [Universal Sidecar package](https://git.sr.ht/~swflint/emacs-universal-sidecar) can add `third-time-section` to `universal-sidecar-sections` to see a summary of the current third-time status in the sidecar.
